	<h1>What Does Supply and Demand Mean?</h1>

<p>Supply and Demand. You probably remember seeing these two words in the business section of newspapers and in your college economic class. But what do these words mean? How do businesses use them? And should these words mean anything to you?

	<h2>Creating "What Does Supply and Demand Mean."</h2>

	<section class = "container-fluid">
	<p>This video was created from a question I constantly ask myself: “What does supply and demand mean for me—the consumer.”</p>

<p class = "special">In making this video:</p>

<p>First, I storyboarded all of the parts that I would use in my video. This allowed me to judge where all my text, pictures and other elements were going to go in the video. Storyboarding also allowed me get a feel for what motions I would be using in the video. Take at look at some of my panels from my storyboard.</p>

<p>Next, I recorded the lines I had scripted out for my video.</p>

<p>After arranging the sound in Adobe After Effects, I started creating my assets in Adobe Illustrator. The cat, apple, gaming controller, and dress were all originally created by me, and all of these products—like every product produced by a business—are subjected to the laws of supply and demand.</p>

<p>Once my assets were created, I could finally arrange them in the video. I brought them to life through the use of wiggling, looping, and sound mixing.</p>

<p>This video was created with the help of motion graphics. I created and arranged all assets and backgrounds used in the video.</p>
